####
RIPWHINE - an easy-to-use single purpose ripper and encoder
####

Requires ``python-musicbrainz2``

Not configurable, you can set the destination dir in the UI.

A one-day hack job.

Usage
-----

$ python setup.py install

Launch with ``./ripwhine``

The menu is pretty self-evident. raw_input and the messaging
don't play well together, so hitting enter will refresh
the state like after [i].

Feel free to experiment with it, it can't break anything!

Quickstart
----------

* Insert CD
* i for identify
* r for rip

Exchange a new CD in and GOTO 10

Greets and email
----------------

Props to part for pointing me at musicbrainz to replace freedb.
